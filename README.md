Wouldn’t it be great to have an online place to hang out during this social distancing pandemic? An online virtual immersive area that doesn’t require you to download or install on your computer? A place that is accessible to everyone regardless of your hardware limitation. Virtual Reality headset not needed. A place where we can directly visit via a shared hyperlink on the web. A place to gather and socialize because of the pandemic. Our social connection doesn’t have to be confined to our current reality. Our hangout doesn’t need to be monetized. We could be engaged in a world with zero advertisements. What’s the catch? None. What’s needed? Just you.
